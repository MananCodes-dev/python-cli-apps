# 🧮 MiniCalcLang – A Custom Calculator Language

A simple interpreted language built in Python that can evaluate math expressions.  
This project marks the **beginning of my language design journey** as part of the *100 Python CLI Tools Challenge*.

## 🚀 Features
- Supports basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- Handles parentheses: `(10 - 3) * 2`  
- Interactive **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**  
- Tokenizer + Evaluator design (baby steps into interpreters)

- **Language:** Python 3.x 🐍  
- **Libraries:** `re` (regex for tokenizing)
