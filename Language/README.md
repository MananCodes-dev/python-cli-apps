# 🧮 MiniCalcLang – A Custom Calculator Language

A simple interpreted language built in Python that can evaluate math expressions.  
This project marks the **beginning of my language design journey** as part of the *100 Python CLI Tools Challenge*.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Supports basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- Handles parentheses: `(10 - 3) * 2`  
- Interactive **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**  
- Tokenizer + Evaluator design (baby steps into interpreters)  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x 🐍  
- **Libraries:** `re` (regex for tokenizing)

# 🧮 MiniCalcLang v0.2 — Variables Enabled

This version of **MiniCalcLang** adds support for **variables and assignments**, making it a step closer to becoming a real programming language.  
You can now declare variables, reuse them in expressions, and build more complex calculations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Declare variables with `let` or `=`  
  - Example: `let x = 5` or `x = 5`
- Reuse variables in math expressions  
  - Example: `x + 3`, `(x * 2) + 7`
- Error handling for undefined variables  
- Interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x 🐍  
- **Libraries:** `re` (regex for parsing identifiers)
